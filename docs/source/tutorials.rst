Tutorials Overview
==================

*Websaw* ships with a number of example apps each aimed to demonstrate in a *generic* way some of the 
key features of *Websaw*.

The first set of **Tutorials** will be focussed on these shipped **example** apps and we will be 
walking through some of these examples to highlight core areas of fucntionality.

In addition we will build a few simple apps in order to get some *'hands on'* ecaperience as we go. 

We will call these the **Getting Started** tutorials and they are aimed at users still unfamiliar with **Websaw**.
The objective is to explain in greater depth the basic concepts and dempnstrate the power and flexibility of 
**Websaw**. 

.. note::

    Reccomended for users with little or no **Websaw** experience.

The second set of **Tutorials** focusses more on building some simple applicartions from the **ground up**
and will introduce **Pyjsaw** and dempnstrate the power and flexibility of **SPA's**. These will be considerd
**Intermediate** tutorials and will be suitable for those who have mastered concepts outlined in the **Getting Started**
tutorials.

Finally we will have a set of **Advanced** tutorials where we will explore advanced concepts and build some more
advanced applications, including the introduction of **VoodooDal**. 

This set of turorials will be suitable for those who are comfortable with the concepts
and functionality as per the first two sets of tutorials and should not be attempted without such.

Depending on your level of comfort it is not necessary to follow these tutorials in any strict sequence 
and we trust that there is somethign for everyone right here.
