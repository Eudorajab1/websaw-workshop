Tutorials Overview
==================

All the tutorials in this guide are designed to act as building blocks and we strongly reccomend that you familiarise yourself
with each of the concepts portraxed in each of the sections before moving on to the next.

We will start with a few simple applications that will highlight the one or more of the fundamental building blocks 
for raid application development using **WebSaw**

We will call these the **Getting Started** tutorials and they are aimed at users unfamiliar with **Websaw**.

The objective is to explain in greater depth the basic concepts and demonstrate the power and flexibility of 
**WebSaw**. You can get started right away :ref:`getting_started` here.

As we progress we will explore the many options available including the use of the **UPYTL** template renedering engine along with incorporating
**Vue**, **pyhonic SPA app development** using **Pyjsaw** and a number of DB wrappers including **Voodoodal** all of 
which have been carefully selected and vetted in order to ensure complete compliance and compatibility both thechnically
and philosophically.

Later **Tutorials** will focus more on the **UPYTL** rendering engine allowing us to builf up our own **Warehouse** of 
re-useable components as we go.

.. note::

    Reccomended for users with little or no **WebSaw** experience.

The second set of **Tutorials** focusses more on building some more complex applicartions from the **ground up**
and will introduce **Pyjsaw** and dempnstrate the power and flexibility of **SPA's**. These will be considerd
**Intermediate** tutorials and will be suitable for those who have mastered concepts covered in the **Getting Started**
tutorials.

Finally we have a set of **Advanced** tutorials where we will explore advanced concepts and build some more
advanced applications. If you are familiar with basic and intermediate web app developement you can jump straight to this
set of tutorials which will showcase some of the more advanced features of **Websaw** with real life apps.

.. note::

    Depending on your level of comfort it is not necessary to follow these tutorials in any strict sequence 
    and we trust that there is somethign for everyone right here.
