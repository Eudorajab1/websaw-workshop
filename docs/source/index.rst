WebSaw Workshop Userguide
=========================


Here we will demonstrate the power and flexibility of **Websaw** by walking you through a number of 
example applications with a series of **Tutorials** designed to act as building blocks to get you 
up-to-speed on developing awesome applications with this superb framework.

In order to gain the maximum benefit from the workshop, you should already have **Websaw** (minimum)
installed in your development environment and if you need any assistance with that please head on over to
`Websaw User Guide <https://websaw-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_ for installation and initial setup insturctions.

We will start off with a set of walkthroughs examining and detailing the sample apps that ship with
**WebSaw** with the view to using them as essesntial building blocks later when we develop our own
applications from scratch putting all the bits together.

We will cover the different types of template rendering options offered with **WebSaw** with the emphasis on 
**UPYTL** as our templating engine and how to build a **Warehoue** of reusable components.

We will also look at **Voodoodal** and how to incorporate it into our applications in order to give us a 
more structured pythonic way of defineing our db tables and fields and of course accesing various databases.

Finally we will cover the installation of **Pyjsaw** for those of you who want to create stunning SPA (Single Page Applications)
that integrate seamlessly with **Websaw** to give untold flexibility and fucntionality when it comes 
to producing web based applications.

Source code for all the examples and tutorials covered by the **Workshop** can be found 
in the `Websaw Workshop <https://github.com/Eudorajab1/websaw-workshop.git>`_ repository under the apps 
folder.

Please feel free to clone the apps and this documetation in order to have a local copy to hand shoudl it be required.

In addition there are some advanced **Showcase** applications developed using **Websaw** that can be 
found `Here <https://github.com/Eudorajab1/websaw-awesome.git>`_  but we scrongly reccomend that you familiarise yourself with the basics
before jumping in to the deep end.

We assune that if you are here that you are familiar with the concepts as in the `Websaw User Guide <https://websaw-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ 
and if not we strongly reccomend that you do so before going too much further.
